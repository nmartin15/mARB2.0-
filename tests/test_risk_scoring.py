"""Tests for risk scoring functionality.

This module contains tests for the RiskScorer service which calculates
overall risk scores for claims based on multiple risk factors including
coding, documentation, payer rules, historical patterns, and ML predictions.

Note: Comprehensive risk scoring tests are located in test_risk_scorer_expanded.py.
This file serves as a placeholder for additional risk scoring test scenarios
that may be added in the future.

Test Coverage:
    - Risk score calculation and component scoring
    - Risk level assignment (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
    - Recommendation generation based on risk factors
    - Pattern detection integration
    - ML service integration and error handling
